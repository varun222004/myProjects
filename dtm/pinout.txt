### **Additional Notes:**

- **Power Supply for nRF24L01+**: The nRF24L01+ requires a **3.3V** power supply. Ensure that the Arduino's 3.3V pin is used to power the module, as applying 5V may damage the nRF24L01+ module.
  
- **Servos**: Servos can typically be powered directly from the Arduino's 5V pin, but if you're using multiple servos or larger ones, it might be better to use an external power supply for the servos (e.g., 5V battery pack), as Arduino's 5V pin may not supply enough current.

- **Servo Movement Range**: The `servo.write()` function takes values between `0` (fully left) and `180` (fully right). Adjust the angles in the functions (`moveForward()`, `moveBackward()`, etc.) as necessary based on the range of motion you want for each servo.

### How to Use This Pinout Guide:
- **Copy and paste** this guide directly into a text document or notes application for quick reference.
- **Ensure your Arduino board** is correctly powered and the servos are receiving adequate voltage.
- **Connect the wires** to the corresponding pins for each module and servo motor as listed in the table above.
